Here, we are given a string of two types of emojis "thumbs up" and "thumbs down".

This is one of those rare low hanging fruit type of question where you don't have to mentally torture yourself to arrive at a reasonable approach.

I just had to convert the stream of emojis into binary 1s and 0s and convert the binary to ascii and I got the flag.

Flag is ```ictf{enc0ding_is_n0t_encrypti0n_1b2e0d43}```
